# Cafeteria Flow Simulator

A simulation project focused on understanding and improving the flow of people in a cafeteria. The main goal is to analyze the current process, identify bottlenecks, and propose improvements to enhance service quality and customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

This simulator models the cafeteria workflow, providing insights into areas where efficiency can be improved. It helps visualize the movement of customers, wait times, and service bottlenecks through event-driven simulations.

## Features

- Simulates the flow of customers in a cafeteria
- Analyzes bottlenecks and service delays
- Provides insights for process optimization
- Event-driven architecture for realistic simulation

## System Diagrams
